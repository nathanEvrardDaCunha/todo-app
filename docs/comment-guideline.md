---

Make them brief
Keep them relevant
Use them liberally, but not to excess

- Comment only before the relevant part
- Use formal and profesisonal tone
- Look out for spelling mistake
- No in-line comment
- Explain why not how
- Use // only
- Use mainstream comment:
    - TODO: things to implement.
    - FIXME: things to fix.
    - NOTE: flexible things.
    - HACK: work but non-standard things.
    - DEPRECATED: outdated things.

```js
//HACK: Poor performance because of double for loop implementation.
function searchUserIntoDatabse(id) {...}
```
